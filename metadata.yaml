description: Many of James Oliver Curwood's action-adventure novels follow intrepid
  explorers who are equal parts foolish and brave as they make their way in the wilds
  of northern Canada. In The Courage of Marge O'Doone, a chance encounter on a train
  turns into the adventure of a lifetime for two audacious souls. Will the pair be
  able to make it back alive?
